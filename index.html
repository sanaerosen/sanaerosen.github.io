<p><b>Contact:</b> (my full name separated by a dot) @ gmail.com

    <p>  I'm currently a software engineer at Yelp, working on the Core Android team (Android infrastructure), since February 2017.

Previously I completed a PhD at the university, where my advisor was <a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/~zmao">Professor Z. Morley Mao</a> and I was part of the <a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/robustnet/people.html">Robustnet</a> research group.  I graduated from the University of Toronto with a BASc in Engineering Science (Electrical and Computer Engineering). For most of my career I've worked on Android-adjacent projects, starting with an Android security focused research project in undergrad in 2010.  Early on in my PhD I moved from a focus on privacy and security to a focus on mobile networking, which is still a strong interest --- I've frequently worked on networking problems on my current team, although I've also worked on a wide range of Android infrastructure projects and rotated onto a feature team for half a year.

How do I pronounce your first name?
</p>

<p>
 It rhymes with "eye", not with "hay", and the emphasis is on the second syllable.  If you get it wrong, I won't be offended. If you're familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">IPA</a>, then it's pronounced [sanae].
