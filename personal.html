You can find me otherwise on twitter (sanaerosen), where I don't post regularly or really post any valuable content.  If I do post anything substantial here though I'll probably link it on my twitter.

I have a number of non-tech hobbies that I plan to start keeping track of here instead of scattered across Instagram etc, in a futile attempt to revive the personal, ad-free webpage.  

I also want to get better at writing.

Tabletop RPGs
</p>

<p>
I'm a big fan of tabletop RPGs and board games, and I often DM Dungeons and Dragons. Here's some content I've produced for it:

Fibre arts
</p>

<p>
Right now most of this is on my instagram (sanaerosen) or on  <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/projects/sanaerosen">Ravelry.</a>  I plan to move more content here, especially stuff other than knitting (sewing, spinning, dyeing, weaving).  I also have done a talk on the history of fibre arts and how it relates to computer science that I plan to eventually write up and post here. 
</p>

<p>
For now I have two projects that I'm both happy with and were easy to find when I was writing this: the first are the weavings I'm most proud of, and the second are some improvised embroidery linen napkins I have never used, with matching coasters (which I have used).

Blacksmithing
</p>

I started taking blacksmithing classes about a year ago.  I'm not yet terribly good at it, this section is here to remind me to update this with photos about my progress.  I take classes at the Crucible in Oakland, CA.
