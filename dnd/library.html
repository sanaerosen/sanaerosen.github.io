<p>
The motivation for this campaign was that my players wanted to play an all-wizard campaign.  Wizards don't stand up to combat on their own very much, and have a lot of interesting tools that could be used in creative ways, so I wanted to create a campaign that reflects that.  There is the option for more combat, though, if the players want, though I feel it's more interesting if they go with non-combat options. NPC motivations are sketched out broadly because it seems likely the adventure will go off the rails.  It should scale to any number of players you can handle (as long as they don't try and fight the dragon) and you can do fun things like have a half-orc wizard.
</p>
<p>

This game is a little silly, the way discworld is, but not "random", and works best with characters with slightly absurd premises played straight.  Murderhobo types don't work so well.  Characters entirely focused around combat are likely to get bored.  It's a good idea for everyone to boost some skills that aren't optimal. Also, everyone should be on board with the idea of being librarians.
</p>
<p>

I ran this twice, and it went completely differently each time. I ran it in D&D 5E but I see no reason why it couldn't work in any vaguely medieval fantasy game.  
</p>
<p>

I originally tried writing this the way wizards of the coast writes scenarios, with a series of branching paths between encounters that players will take.  That didn't work out at all.  Instead, I have some NPCs with their motivations and goals, some locations and encounters, and a rough sketch of the paths players might take between them.
</p>
<p>

I also don't have exact numbers  or stats.  Use approximate level-appropriate monsters as needed if stats come up, and use the standard difficulty levels for your edition as appropriate.  In terms of loot, I usually try and hand out things the party will like.
</p>

<p class="sidebar">

For wizards, divination and enchantment works well.  Evocation worked out best of the combat-focused ones.  I played once with only wizards, and once with an assortment of classes which weren't made specifically for the campaign, and I feel like making characters specifically for the campaign works better.  

There are some interesting directions you could go with other single-class parties. An order of library paladins? Clerics of the library god? Warlocks who have sold their soul to the library?  Assassins (rogues) who hunt down those who would break the library rules, or monks who enforce them - no weapons allowed in the library!  Sorcerers who draw their power from ancient books? Bards, who have devoted their lives to memorizing and reciting oral traditions, who are essentially living books?

</p>

<p class="title">
The Premise
</p>

<p>

In this world there is a giant library, the main library for the kingdom.  The party works for the library and enforces its rules.  The rules are as follows:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>The library is to provide learning and knowledge to all, powerful or weak, rich or poor.</li>
    <li>There is to be no excessive noise in the library.</li>
    <li>Library books must be returned by their due date.  If they are not returned, they will be retrieved and a fine extracted.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>

The king is in a precarious position, politically.  Recent military defeats have made him look weak, and many other members of the royal family, in particular his sister, are looking for an excuse to depose him.
</p>
<p>

There's a ceremony that takes place once a year, where the king reads from this book.  It's the original of a book that pertains to the founding of the kingdom. The ceremony is now just a formality, a routine occurrence, but rumours have spread that if it doesn't happen, an obscure law will be invoked that might be enough to depose the king. 
</p>
<p>

The book is kept in the library, but obviously is not supposed to be checked out.  However, a junior librarian has mistakenly checked the book out to a mysterious individual named Kirigaranan.  The ceremony is in three days, and the kingdom is at risk.  But more importantly, the book is now overdue.
</p>
<p>

The book has the name and an address written down, but the address is in "Kenku Town", and nobody knows where that is.  Only a scholar of the Kenku would be likely to know about it.  Unfortunately, the local scholars have all disappeared, and all scholarly journals have been removed from the library...
</p>
<p class="title">
The Antagonists 
</p>
<p>

<b>Lady Jair</b>  The sister of the king. In her late 40's, hair pulled back into a tight bun.  She wears plain but severe clothes.  She doesn't speak much, but when she speaks everyone listens.  She runs the Office of Information, under which falls both the spy agency and the library, although she hates the library - information should be tightly controlled, and seditious books burned. She's rather fond of very expensive wine.  She's very ambitious and is next in line for the throne - it's not a secret that she is manoevering to undermine her brother - but she won't commit murder or other extremely evil acts to get her way.  She sees herself as a good person, and honestly believes that her becoming queen would be for the good of the kingdom.
</p>
<p>

She isn't exactly behind a complex plot to depose the king, rather she saw opportunities and took them.  Her agents convinced Kirigaranan to steal the book, and she's taking advantage of its absence, but Kirigaranan doesn't know anything about her.
</p>
<p>

She's one of the few people who knows where the kenku live.  In one game, the party managed to extract that information from her with a lot of wine, high charisma, and a little bit of magical help.

<b>Kirigaranan</b>  Kirigaranan is a kenku.  In this adventure, kenku are reclusive, living in houses on stilts in swamps, getting by mostly by fishing. Very little is known about them, and the area where they live is protected by ancient illusion magic.  Uncharacteristically, Kirigaranan came to the city to sell some crafts and fell in love with it.  He was particularly fascinated with the library, and learned to read and write over the course of many visits.  He wants his daughter to one day move to the city and get an education, and for that reason wants to bring books with him back to his village.
</p>
<p>

His daughter wants a book about princesses.  He wasn't sure how to find such a thing, and didn't want to ask a librarian because he planned to not bring it back, so wound up talking to someone in a tea shop who was uncharacteristically friendly with him (because he was an agent of Lady Jair).  That man nudged him towards stealing this particular book.
</p>
<p>

He generally means well and doesn't understand the significance of what he's done, although he does know that he shouldn't steal from the library.  He'll be evasive on that point,but otherwise friendly and welcoming if he's visited in his town.
</p>
<p>

He's an expert carver, able to carve incredibly small and intricate scenes [todo insert link].  He's very eager to show them to you. He's considered a bit eccentric by the others, as he's always leaving the kenku swamp and bringing back stuff from the outside world. 
</p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>Beryntanthropal</b> the dragon: He's a young but ambitious red dragon.  Rather than hoarding gold, though, he's decided he can amass more power and renown by hoarding knowledge.  He recently "acquired" a scientific publishing company and charges exorbitant yearly rates for anyone to access these journals.  As a result of budget cuts (introduced by Lady Jair), the library has thus been unable to afford these fees.  He's on good terms with the government, having figured out the value of bribery and corruption to make sure his activities are overlooked.  He lives in an immense but slightly ruined, formerly abandoned castle nearby.
</p>
<p>

He also started kidnapping academics and forcing them to write papers for him.  Among those kidnapped is Beatha, the only one in this area who studies the kenku.
</p>
<p class="title">
Other characters
</p>

<p>
<b>Beatha</b>  She studies the kenku, and is one of the few people who knows where they live.  She's well-liked, and frequented the tea shops where many scholars spent their time.  Her disappearance was noted by them, and it's known she was going to submit a paper on the kenku to Beryntanthropal before she disappeared.  She's currently imprisoned in the dragon's dungeons, churning out papers.  She isn't a fighter, but can most likely safely sneak out after being rescued.  She's completely willing to share the location of the kenku with the party if rescued.
</p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>Raxathara the copper dragon:</b>  She's arrogant and hard to work with, but sees Beryntanthropal as a rival and can be convinced to undermine him (she doesn't plan on killing him).  She owns a series of roast chicken shops that have gotten very popular.  She hoards relationships with people and is generally quite gregarious.  She can shapeshift, and often takes the form of a woman with red hair wearing an elaborate copper scale dress (she wants to make sure people knows she's a dragon).  She's a well-known figure in the city, and doesn't care very much who runs the city.
</p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>The king:</b>  The king is a distant and hard to reach figure, a name never came up for him.  The players would have to go through many, many layers of bureaucracy to reach him.  Unlike his sister, he's very hands-off.  He's an ok king for the common people - neither good nor bad, largely not affecting them - but he's made a lot of enemies among the nobility. 
</p>
<p class="title">

Places
</p>
<p>
<b>The library:</b> In the library, there is a complex hierarchy of librarians.  The players are part of the enforcement arm of the library, and while that's a moderately senior position, they do have to answer to the head of the enforcement division if things get  out of hand.
</p>
<p>

Every book that leaves the library is recorded with the name of the book, the name of the person who checked it out, and the address.  The area immediately around the checkout desk is under the influence of a powerful truth spell.  However, addresses are not necessarily helpful if nobody has heard of them.
</p>
<p>

There is an old gnome, Enky, who decides how long books should be checked out, through rolling dice.  He's blind, and can't see the books, but doesn't need to.  The fates will determine the due dates.  If necessary, he can be manipulated to change a due date.
</p>
<p>

With some persuading, the party can borrow a bag of holding and level-appropriate cash from the library.
</p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>The scholars' tea shops:</b>

Here, the local scholars gather after work (or work in the tea shop).  Tea is generally popular in the city, but this tea shop has rarer varieties, because the scholars are often well-traveled, and there's a tradition of bringing tea to sell to the tea shop after going somewhere far away.  The tea shop sells a particularly rare tea, drunk only by the kenku, where the tea leaves are fermented in the swamp.  
</p>
<p>

The people here can tell you all about Beryntanthropal the dragon and are happy to complain at great length about the difficulties of research and in particular of dealing with publishing companies.
</p>
<p>

The scholars are often supported by powerful nobles, so it's not unusual for agents of the nobles to be here.  As librarians, it's likely the party is at least somewhat familiar with the place.
</p>
<hr>
<p>

<b>The dragon's castle:</b>

It's built into the side of the mountain, and has a secret underground entrance.  Inside, the building is maze-like, and the walls are lined with books - clever PCs might realize that it's unlikely that the dragon would use his fire breath in a way that these books might catch fire (and also it might be a good idea to be cautious with fire magic).  The halls are broad enough that a young dragon can manoever through them.  At the entrance is an office where the party can submit a paper for publication, at which point the guards will attempt to imprison them.
</p>
<p>

Acolytes in robes work here - the dragon has amassed a sizeable dragon cult for his age. Most of them are unarmed and nonviolent, but there are a small number of guards and enforcers.  To reach the imprisoned scholars, the guards have to somehow be dealt with.  It might also be difficult to find them.   The dragon isn't always present, but if you take too long or draw too much attention to yourselves he might come back, and if the party wants to, it wouldn't be hard to get the dragon to come back and fight him.
</p>
<p>

Deep in the castle is a dungeon where scholars have been imprisoned, and are forced to churn out research papers. It doesn't matter what they're on - just that Beryntanthropal has more research papers.
</p>
<p>

There is a room that has a map of all libraries in the area, with carefully written notes about hours of operation and who works there.
</p>
<p>

There is also a room with level-appropriate treasure.  One of the items is the Cloak of Billowing, a cloak whose magical property is that it billows dramatically.
</p>
<hr>
<p>


<b>The kenku's swamp</b>

The swamp is surrounded by powerful, ancient illusion magic.  It's surrounded by the illusion of a very tall wall.  Nearby is an old man who, if you figure out the wall is an illusion, will tell you that everyone who has passed that point has died.  He is, in fact, a kenku, and wears a special hat that gives the illusion of him being an old man.  If the party acquires the  hat, that's the only disguise it'll give them.
</p>
<p>

The swamp itself consists of a number of buildings on stilts.  You have to travel between them by boat but boats are conveniently lying around.  The kenku are friendly but bemused that you are there and assume you are also scholars like Beatha, the only human most of them have seen.  There's a central building which has only a roof and railings, where there are many tables at which the party can drink tea and talk with the kenku.  The kenku are unfamiliar with alcohol.  THey all know Kirigaranan and all have really long and hard to remember names.
</p>
<p class="title">
Likely path of the game
</p>
<p>
<ol>
    <li>Discover the book is missing.  Investigate what's going on.  Discover that a kenku stole it, and that they'll need to figure out where the kenku lived.  Discover that all the journals on kenku are gone.</li>
    <li>Most likely, try and find the scholars and free them from the red dragon. </li> 
    <li> Once they have the address of the kenku, retrieve the book.  This shouldn't involve any combat and if they try and fight the kenku they'll just effortlessly slaughter them.  They should probably extract a fine.  One of the times I played, the fine was to have them return to the city to testify against Lady Jair in court.</li> 
</ol>
<p class="title">
Other ideas
</p>
For one group, there was a follow-up adventure where they visited the Library of Babel (from Borges' short story).  The premise was that the gods had imprisoned a tyrant there after his death for the crime of having destroyed an ancient library.  They were doomed to stay there until they could find the one book, out of the infinite combination of books, that contained only their name.  The party would be able to leave the library only if they brought such a book with them.  I didn't really record the details of this adventure though.
