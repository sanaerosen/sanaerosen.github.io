<h2>Antagonistic monsters: Goblinoids v1</h2>

<p>This part, at least at first, isn't that different from normal D&D, in broad strokes.  One key difference is that I say "antagonistic" instead of "evil".  I'm not super keen on alignment in D&D, partly because of philosophical ideas about morality, but also because it often feels like you have one team that puts on the red vest from the big vest box in PE, and the other team puts on the blue vest, so you know what sides you are on. </p>

<p>I won't go into whether these monsters are "evil".  But I do want to make them monstrous - they are frightening, and they are threatening.  Ordinary people are frightened of them, and when you come and rescue them from these monsters, you are a hero.  But these monsters are not irrational, and so rescuing the villagers doesn't necessarily have to mean killing the monsters. </p>
<p> I always like to give players several ways to solve a problem and reward unconventional approaches.  When I give encounter-based XP, I give XP for "defeating" an encounter, which doesn't necessarily mean anyone ever rolls initiative.</p>

<p class="title">Bugbears</p>

<p> In D&D, bugbears are traditionally a type of ambush-based goblinoid, who are also very strong.  In folklore, they were some sort of frightening spirit that lurked in the woods, possibly cognate with "Bogeyman", according to Wikipedia.</p>

<p>In this world, people, especially children, are afraid of the dark, and the dark forests, because there are indeed frightening things out there that eat small, fangless humanoids.  Perhaps there are wolves, perhaps there are tigers, and maybe there are other fantastical creatures like bugbears.  Why do they do this?  Because they are hungry, and humans are not at the top of the food chain in this world.</p>

<p>Bugbears are ambush predators.  They aren't evil, any more than a tiger is evil.  They're large, furry, and mostly like to sleep and eat - not unlike bears in some ways, although they are intelligent humanoids.  They're friendly and nice, if you ever find yourself chatting with one, and coexist peacefully with other bugbears, but rarely form large societies, and mostly keep to themselves.
</p>

<p>Bugbears are not cannibals - they don't eat other bugbears! They generally won't eat any goblinoids, in fact.  Anyone else they can take down is fair game.  But they kill for food, and by leaving out food for them and keeping them well fed, they can be perfectly pleasant neighbours.  There are villages that leave out offerings for the bugbears and have forgotten why, until they stop leaving out the offerings, and people start going missing. They can even sometimes become fond of certain humans, even defensive of them, in much the same way humans can become fond of an animal they might otherwise eat.</p>

<p> There are often a lot of superstitions around bugbears.  Some might only speak of them in hushed tones, to avoid attracting their attention, or refering to them only by euphemisms.  Sometimes magical powers are ascribed to them, though no credible source has observed this.  Some believe that they are somehow supernatural, a physical manifestation of the ancient terrors of the forest.</p>

<p>Bugbear PCs are not impossible, but very rare, and assume the party keeps them very well fed.<p>

<p class="title">Goblins</p>

<p>Unlike hobgoblins, goblins are quite small.  There are some physical resemblances, and like hobgoblins they seem to mysteriously emerge from dense and ancient forests, sometimes apparently out of nowhere.  Some say goblins appear when humans encroach too much on the forest.</p>

<p>Goblins can sometimes happily coexist with humans, though like bugbears it helps to bribe them.  But also, like bugbears, humans and their livestock are their natural prey.  They are highly social amongst themselves, and seem to work together even better than humans do, without ego or politics, and fight very effectively as a group. Humans might call goblins cowardly and lacking in honour, but goblins don't fight for glory or fame, only for food and resources, and usually attack only when success seems sure.</p>

<p>Sometimes, goblins will opportunistically attack humans with no provocation, but in other cases some delicate balance between the humans and the goblins has been upset.  Maybe humans felled the trees around the hollows where the goblins lived, or forgot to leave out milk and bread to bribe them.  Or maybe the goblins have been breaking things in the night and taking livestock and the humans decided to do something about it. </p>

<p class="title">Hobgoblins</p>
<p>It bothers me that in folklore hobgoblins were friendly but mischievous spirits.  I haven't figured out what do to with them.</p>
