  <h2 class="dndh2">Eastern Marches, or getting people to actually commit to D&D</h2>

<p>I've been trying to run a regular RPG game for a while and had a hard time scheduling one. It's easy to find people who want to play, but hard to find people who can regularly commit indefinitely to a game.  A friend pointed me in the direction of the concept of the <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/">West Marches</a> which seemed like it would solve this problem, though I took a somewhat looser interpretation of some of the guidelines.</p>

<p>I had a few goals with this campaign:</p>
  <ol>

  <li>People can drop in whenever, because scheduling is hard.  This is mostly played after work with people who are casually interested in D&D. This precludes a strong story focus. </li>
  <li>However, because I really love the worldbuilding and story-telling aspect of DMing, have the world be rich and complex, full of non-violent options.  The game is, largely, about exploration.</li>
  <li>Stay away from cliches, and avoid basing it on any particular culture. </li>
  </ol>

<p>The premise is that there was, before, the land of the mortals, and in the land of the mortals there was a single city, the first city that there ever was.  The city was near the mountains, which, legend had it, was where humans were once from.  A long time ago, mortals had traveled across the land of demons and spirits to come here, but that was probably legend.  In any case, nobody ever ventured beyond the mountains. </p>

 <p> But the strange magic that the warlocks practiced in that city brought it to ruins.  A single charismatic figure had a vision of the place that they had come from, beyond the mountains, and lead some of the survivors across.  A small number of skilled individuals would scout ahead and find a safe path for the caravan of survivors, though not always the same group.  </p>

<ul>
  <li>A story-based reason to swap out people from week to week.</li>
<li>A reason to base the campaign on exploration and discovery without conquest.  Many of my players are new to RPGs and they very quickly have discovered that they can come up with all sorts of wild non-combat solutions to problems.</li>
<li>A shared purpose that all characters will be on board.</li>
<li>A logical reason why CRs go up as things progress.</li>
<li>I can plan the setting just a few steps ahead, and even sketch out a few ideas per hex.</li>
</ul>

<p> It’s been going for well over a year, after many failed attempts at getting a regular RPG game. I play with people from work. We have a slack channel where every now and then I put up a poll with a few days I'm willing to run the game, and run it on whichever day has the most votes, so long as there are at least three other people. Most of the people who play are new to D&D, and we've got a lot of interns playing, which is especially cool. It definitely has a pretty high success rate while still covering most of the things I want to cover in a game of D&D. </p>

I plan to eventually list out all the hexes, maybe have a clickable map or something, but for now I'll just write up a few for now:

<p class="title">Hex 1: Market Town (and surrounding hexes)</p>

<p>The first people you meet are the goblins.  I didn’t call them that but people figured out pretty quickly they were based on goblins.  Goblins are humanoid - they definitely look like the mortals that the players were used to seeing - but were also very unfamiliar, and were just as bemused to have these strangers show up in town.  They also aren’t necessarily hostile, and definitely not evil.  The first ones the players meet were in Market Town, a pretty ordinary town of ordinary, peaceful people.  They are pretty good at making cheese. </p>

<p>The goblins live in an area of large, flat plains, which they sail around in on wheeled sailboats.  The wind is very important to them, as a result. So the fact that there is no wind right now is a pretty big problem for them.  Also, whenever they leave town they are pursued by stirges - large blood-sucking monsters.   Until the stirges are dealt with, it will definitely not be safe for the caravan to continue. </p>

<p class="title"> Hex 2: The land pirates <p>
<p>If the players go looking for the source of the stirges, on the way, they find some goblins in a land ship: these ones are some sort of raiding party, and they allude to a war going on before attacking. These particular goblins are on a mission to conquer anything in their path, including unfortunately the party.  They also have fast-moving land-boats, and a vicious trained falcon, and the party does not.  They mention following the <b>Lord of the West Wind</b>, and have a blue flag. </p>

<p class="title"> Hex 3: The strange statue <p>

  <p>After dealing with this situation, the party finds a sort of crude statue, clearly made by one individual without much experience making such things, in front of a sort of altar. The party quickly realizes there is a malevolent spirit associated with this statue: one of the goblins was killed in a war, and is now angry, and has brought the plague of stirges as revenge on the living.  The spirit must be defeated and the statue destroyed to banish it so that Market Town can be safe.</p>

<p>These last two hexes hint at new problems up ahead, though.  The goblins of Market Town are trying to stay out of it, but a war has broken out on the fields ahead.  How will the caravan get through safely?</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p>The meta-goals here for hexes 1-3 are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce the idea that monsters that are conventionally hostile may not be, in this setting. </li>
<li>On this other side of the mountains, things are a little stranger, and the separation between mortals and the spirits and gods are fuzzier. </li>
<li>Hint at the challenges they will have to address ahead.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p class="title"> Hex 4: Kaw and Oriax </p>

<p>A kenku and aarakocra sit atop a tower.  The players will probably first try and figure out what is up with this tower.  Is there a danger here?  </p>

<p>Eventually, they will speak with the inhabitants.  They are entirely peaceful, and named Kaw and Oriax.  They will happily tell you things they know about the surrounding area.  </p>

<p>They have been here basically forever.  They sit and medidate and comtemplate the universe, and urge you to stay and do the same.  Give up your foolish mortal goals, they say.  That is how your ancestors lost their immortality, by the desire to change and strive and build.  Stay here.  But they don’t try and force you. </p>

<p>Up north, they say, you can see the universe being formed.</p>
