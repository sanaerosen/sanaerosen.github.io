  I'm a big fan of tabletop RPGs and board games, and I've DMed Dungeons and Dragons for over a decade now, although I've also played a pretty wide range and DMed a few other systems.  During quarantine, I started writing up some of my ideas.  I wrote up some adventures that I've run a few times, and then, realizing I have a lot of opinions about what my ideal D&D-style RPG would look like, I started writing them up.  Most of these ideas aren't yet polished enough to be published, and I also realize that writing an entirely new D&D-style RPG is not something I'm likely to finish any time soon, so I'm trying to instead write up some system-agnostic content.</p>

  <p>I also was in the <a href="https://www.rpgwriterworkshop.com/">Summer 2020 RPG Writer's Workshop</a> and in addition to the mostly free content I've posted on the website, I'm in the process of releasing a paid adventure.  Hopefully it won't be my last one either!  But until that's done the other content is mostly on pause.</p>

  <p class="title">Homebrew setting</p>

  <p>
    How is this new setting different?  I've realized that when people say something is "low magic" or "realistic" they often mean something very different than what I mean.  I want things to be consistent. I want to deeply explore the impact of magic on the world.  I want non-magical characters that are complex. I don't want non-human races that are all culturally identical, or Medieval Europe with magic dropped on top. I want to inject my hobbies about traditional crafts into this setting, so expect some really detailed considerations of fabric production to subtly rear their heads.
