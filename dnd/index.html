  I'm a big fan of tabletop RPGs and board games, and I often DM Dungeons and Dragons, although I've also run some other systems and have played a pretty wide range.  I've recently started producing content: first writing up adventures that I've run a couple times, and then, in a combination of boredom and inspiration during the quarantine, I've started making my own version of D&D that addresses all my pet peeves.  Recognizing that this is a very ambitious project that I'll almost certainly never finish, I'm starting by making it instead a bunch of setting content and general standalone thoughts on D&D.</p>

  <p>
    Why D&D?  People often say that in this day of indie RPGs, most of which are more elegant and polished, why would you play something as clunky as D&D?  And I still do enjoy non D&D games - I've been playing a variety of PbtA games lately, and DMing a play by post game of Heart.  There are a lot of game styles out there, and I reccommend trying a variety. But D&D does one thing very well, and that's being a giant pile of miscellaneous fiddly stuff.  A lot of people hate it, for that reason.  But I like it.
  </p>
  <p>My grandiose goal is to one day make my own D&D variant, but for now, I'll use D&D 5e for examples of how this content can be applied. However, the ideas aren't edition specific.</p>
<p>
  How is this new setting different?  I've realized that when people say something is "low magic" or "realistic" they often mean something very different than what I mean.  I want things to be consistent. I want to deeply explore the impact of magic on the world.  I want non-magical characters that are complex. I don't want non-human races that are all culturally identical, or Medieval Europe with magic dropped on top. I want to inject my hobbies about traditional crafts into this setting, so expect some really detailed considerations of fabric production to subtly rear their heads.
