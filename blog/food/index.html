<h2 class="dndh2">Blogging about food, because why not. </h2>

<p>It has been a mere two weeks since I first posted about preparation for coronavirus though it feels like an eternity longer.  I am pretty happy about the preparation I've done but still have not totally given up on fresh food.  I have been trying really hard to acquire a chicken with limited success.  I haven't yet given up on fresh food completely and have planned one last elaborate meal, though my attempts to keep a distance from people have been stymied by the fact that people seem to be doing all their panic buying now and there is literally no chicken left in the store. I had what I thought was a grocery list that will not overlap with the panic but nope.  At least most people don't realize the value of granny smith apples yet (it's pi day!)</p>

<p>We're also now limited by the fact that our fridge is pretty small.  Freezer space must be negociated with my roommate, and even the fridge is getting crowded.  I also plan to inventory my food today and explicitly plan meals. I hope to be able to occasionally go to the grocery store until my roommate or I get sick, but I'm increasingly nervous about the crowds there.</p>

<p> Ok, now that I have talked about unrelated things as is mandatory, here's what I've been doing for food. Eventually I'll organize these on different pages.</p>

Other things I have planned for the near future:
<ul>
  <li>Chicken shawarma + homemade hummus + homemade pita bread + greek salad, if I ever find that chicken, and feast for days</li>
  <li>Rhubarb apple pie</li>
  <li>Regular apple pie?</li>
  <li>Miso soup </li>
  </ul>

<p><b>Soba</b></p>
<p>I made this for lunch on a weekday, super quick and easy to make. Conveniently this is all stuff I've had for months, but your local, relatively not busy Asian supermarket should carry it all.</p>

<ol>
  <li> Boil the soba noodles (buckwheat noodles) according to the instructions on the package, should be like 6 minutes.</li>
  <li>Take 2 parts water, 1 part soy sauce, 1 part mirin (Japanese cooking wine), a bit of dashi (fish stock) and boil it together.  I did this in the microwave. For one person you need max like a total of a quarter cup.</li>
  <li>Cool noodles in cold water, cool sauce in the fridge.</li>
  <li>Drain noodles, pour sauce on top, enjoy with some nori (dried seaweed) if you have it on hand.</li>
</ol>

<p><b> Granola </b> </p>
<p>This recipe is from my mom.  I haven't yet made it, but I'm about to.</p>
<p>Other breakfast items have been bacon and eggs (but now the eggs need conserving for more important things and the bacon goes in the freezer), instant pancake mix, oatmeal with frozen berries and now-precious milk, yogurt, a slice of plain bread, and the ever popular just waiting until lunch.  Granola however is easy to make, or so my mom has always said.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
  Heat 1/2 cup of canola oil and 1/2 cup honey in a metal pan until it bubbles at the edge</li>
  <li>Spread 4 cups of oats and whatever nuts and dried fruit you lkeon a baking pan</li>
  <li>Add the oil/honey mixture</li>
  <li> Bake until golden brown, maybe like 15 minutes </li>
  </ol>
